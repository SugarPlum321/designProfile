    <h1>Is it Old or is it New?</h1>
    <p>
      I was part of a group that was tasked to revamp an unemployment website by
      designing a new interface that was user-friendly. If you have never seen
      an unemployment site, most tend to be outdated but some make an effort to
      stay up with the time. The West Virginia Unemployment (will refer to as
      WVU for short) site was somewhere in between. My role in this project was
      Project Manager as well as UX/UI designer.

    <h1>It doesn't have to be confusing.</h1>
    <p>
      The amount of data that was present on the site was not just overwhelming
      at times but also scattered. We did a design sprint (5 days long) to shift
      thought and condense the site's information completing a content inventory
      ( finding dead links, duplicates, and important links that were hidden in
      a cave). Doing this allowed us to find the pain points and the hot spots
      that the users would be looking for.

    <h1>Testing, Iteration, More testing</h1>
    <p>
      It was at this point we had gathered enough information to where we could
      start making wireframes and testing. Evaluate, Separate, converge and
      repeat We did this several times throughout the process trying to come up
      with a layout that not only made sense but was pleasing and calming for
      the user to use. Our target was to make the claim process clean, easy, and
      straightforward. We focused on using grides to keep the layout clean and
      tidy from the start. We utilize ‘Web Accessibility In Mind’ (WebAIM) to
      make sure our color choice passed the Contrast Ratio test as well.
