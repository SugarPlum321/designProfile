    <h1>Where have all the Artists gone?</h1>
    <p>
      Our focus for this project: What issues the art Community we're facing And
      did aspiring artists or artists looking to advance their skills have
      trouble finding a mentor or a learning platform to their liking.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had 4 weeks to carry out our research and creating a prototype. As the
      project manager, I assess what are deliverables were for the week and
      broke down tasks into manageable pieces.
    </p>
    <h1>What is an Artist?</h1>
    <p>
      First, we tried to get into the headspace of our users by each of us
      coming up with an archetype and a persona. What challenges were they
      facing? Why would they be looking to improve their art? Why might they be
      wanting to teach art? Art being very Diverse in mediums, we decided to
      focus more so on traditional art, painting and drawing mostly for this
      exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half of our group, there were 4 of us, actually had previous art
      experience. I myself at the time wanted to learn more about gouache. What
      we had come up with was students, like me, who wanted to learn a new art
      medium or wanted resources to learn from and teachers who wanted to pass
      on their knowledge or wanted to share their love of art with the
      community.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our next task was to find out if our thoughts were correct or if they were
      way out in left field. So we conducted several interviews, with art
      students and established artists, and made a Google survey to see what
      artists we were looking to learn, and where they mostly get their
      information from.
    </p>
    <p>
      What we found in our interviews was kind of surprising, most artists are
      both the teacher and the student. In that that those who know a lot about
      their art, and teach it, seek to learn more or experience it. Even those
      Who are starting out would share resources or what they've learned to
      those around them. Our survey showed that a vast majority of people used
      YouTube to learn art Yet a high number of people preferred workshop
      environments. The most sought-after medium to learn was painting and
      drawing.
    </p>
    <h1>What do artist want</h1>
    <p>
      From here we synthesized our data into post notes on Miro and Organize
      them into pain points, types of learning, and what was important to the
      artist. We had a lot that convey that peer review and feedback were very
      important for them as well as freedom of expression and ease of access.
      [insted how might we slide]
    </p>
    <p>
      We found our goal! Through our findings, we discovered how important
      validation is to an artist that they are improving in their art and that
      they have a community that encourages freedom of expression. To see how we
      could turn this into a platform/app/website we made a Created Matrix in
      Miro. Noting all the different necessities an artist would be looking for
      or inquiring about Depending on where they are on their Journey. Along the
      way, we discovered that our Matrix actually represented the growth of an
      artist and a potential business model for a website.
